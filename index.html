         <p class="w3-white w3-text-black w3-left-align text-p">
          Pet culture has developed rapidly since ancient times, with dogs being one of the most popular pets due to their loyalty and faithfulness. In modern times, dogs are still deeply embedded in human lives as a representation of companionship as well as beloved members of the family.
          In recent years, the number of dog owners has grown sustainably. In the United States, the percentage of households owning dogs has increased from 38.4% to 44.5% from 2016 to 2022[1].</p>
         <p class="w3-left-align w3-white w3-text-black text-p">However, as the number of dog owners has snowballed, the number of dogs abandoned or relinquished also experienced a huge increase, which results in great pressure on animal shelters in the U.S. According to Stephanie Filer,  Shelter Animals Count’s executive director,  “Shelters are quite literally at crisis[2].” The below graph shows the gap between the dogs entering and leaving animal shelters, the structure of entry and outcome types of these dogs, and how they have changed in recent years.</p>

      <tableau-viz id="tableauViz"

      </tableau-viz>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="w3-left-align w3-white w3-text-black text-p">From 2020 to 2023, the gap keeps increasing, taking lots of the shelter's resources. As a result, most of the dogs backlogged in shelters will only see euthanasia as their end. The non-live outcome of dogs in shelters has indeed seen an obvious increase over the years. The root of all this is the irresponsible abandonment of their dogs by dog owners, as stray dogs and relinquished dogs take up the majority of total dogs entering animal shelters.
        As reported in the article on TIME[2], the biggest reasons that dog owners give up their dogs are landlord disputes, pet restrictions, and financial pressure.

      <p class="w3-left-align w3-white w3-text-black text-p">
        Owning a pet dog requires a lot of financial and community support - we all know this. The problem is that many pet owners don't think deeply enough about the decision to get a dog. A survey conducted on 2,000 dog owners showed that 54% of dog owners have regretted the decision to keep a dog[3]. It is these immature dog ownership decisions that are contributing to the problem of the shelter backlog and the threat of death to the dogs in the shelters. 
        Finance is one of the biggest burdens for dog owners. Study shows that in 2023, 91% of dog owners have suffered from financial stress due to pet care costs[4]. Thus, we develpoed the following visualization to show an overview of dog keeping cost and help dog owners make more informed decisions about their pet ownership based on their financial status.
